# High Performance Python Analysis (Planned for v0.8.0+)

**Future integration of "High Performance Python" (3rd Edition) patterns**

## Status: Planning Phase

This document outlines the planned analysis and integration of "High Performance Python" patterns to complement our "Effective Python" foundation.

## Analysis Framework (Future)

### Target Book
- **"High Performance Python" (3rd Edition)** by Micha Gorelick and Ian Ozsvald
- **Focus**: Performance optimization, profiling, and advanced techniques
- **Complementary to**: "Effective Python" (Pythonic patterns + Performance patterns)

### Planned Analysis Methodology

**Same systematic approach as Effective Python:**
1. **Chapter-by-chapter analysis** of all items
2. **Gap analysis** against existing performance tools
3. **AST detectability assessment** for each pattern
4. **Priority classification** based on impact and implementability
5. **Integration planning** with existing EFP rules

### Anticipated Rule Categories

#### String and Memory Optimization (HP001-HP020)
- **HP001**: String concatenation in loops → use `str.join()`
- **HP002**: String formatting performance patterns
- **HP003**: Memory-efficient string operations
- **HP004**: Unicode handling optimization

#### Collection Performance (PC001-PC020)
- **PC001**: List membership testing → use `set` for O(1) lookup
- **PC002**: Efficient sorting and searching patterns
- **PC003**: Generator vs list performance trade-offs
- **PC004**: Dictionary optimization techniques

#### Memory Optimization (MC001-MC020)
- **MC001**: Missing `__slots__` → memory optimization
- **MC002**: Generator expressions vs list comprehensions
- **MC003**: Memory profiling-based suggestions
- **MC004**: Reference counting optimization

#### NumPy and Scientific Computing (NP001-NP020)
- **NP001**: Manual loops over arrays → NumPy vectorization
- **NP002**: Inefficient array operations
- **NP003**: Broadcasting optimization opportunities
- **NP004**: Memory layout optimization

### Integration Strategy

#### Phase 4 Implementation Plan (v0.8.0+)

**Prerequisites:**
- Complete "Effective Python" coverage (26 EFP rules)
- Established user base and feedback
- Performance baseline established

**Approach:**
1. **Complementary Rules**: Focus on performance where EFP focuses on style
2. **No Overlap**: Ensure HP rules don't duplicate EFP educational value
3. **Unified Experience**: Consistent error message format and book references
4. **Progressive Adoption**: Allow users to enable HP rules selectively

#### Technical Considerations

**Detection Complexity:**
- Performance patterns often require more sophisticated analysis
- May need runtime profiling data integration
- Could require dataflow analysis for memory patterns

**User Experience:**
- Clear separation between style (EFP) and performance (HP) suggestions
- Configurable performance impact thresholds
- Educational context for performance trade-offs

### Anticipated Challenges

#### Analysis Complexity
- **Performance patterns** often context-dependent
- **Profiling data** may be needed for accurate detection
- **Trade-offs** between readability and performance

#### Tool Ecosystem
- **perflint** and other performance tools may overlap
- **Need careful gap analysis** to avoid duplication
- **Integration complexity** with existing performance tooling

#### Educational Integration
- **Different audience** (performance-focused vs style-focused)
- **Combined learning curve** for both books
- **Balanced recommendations** when EFP and HP conflict

## Preliminary Rule Examples

### HP001: String Concatenation in Loops

```python
# ❌ Performance anti-pattern (detected by HP001)
result = ""
for item in large_list:
    result += process(item)  # O(n²) performance

# ✅ High-performance alternative
result = "".join(process(item) for item in large_list)  # O(n) performance
```

**Book Reference**: "High Performance Python" Ch. 2: Profiling
**Performance Impact**: O(n²) → O(n) for large datasets
**Detection**: String += in loop context

### PC001: List Membership Testing

```python
# ❌ Performance anti-pattern (detected by PC001)
allowed_items = ["item1", "item2", "item3", "item4", "item5"]
if user_input in allowed_items:  # O(n) lookup
    process(user_input)

# ✅ High-performance alternative
allowed_items = {"item1", "item2", "item3", "item4", "item5"}  # Set
if user_input in allowed_items:  # O(1) lookup
    process(user_input)
```

**Book Reference**: "High Performance Python" Ch. 3: Lists and Tuples
**Performance Impact**: O(n) → O(1) for membership testing
**Detection**: List literal used in membership testing

### MC001: Missing __slots__

```python
# ❌ Memory inefficient (detected by MC001)
class DataPoint:
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

# ✅ Memory optimized
class DataPoint:
    __slots__ = ['x', 'y', 'z']  # Reduces memory usage

    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z
```

**Book Reference**: "High Performance Python" Ch. 6: Matrices and Vectors
**Performance Impact**: ~40% memory reduction for simple classes
**Detection**: Classes without `__slots__` that could benefit

## Future Timeline

### v0.8.0: High Performance Python Foundation
- Complete "High Performance Python" analysis
- Implement first 5-10 HP rules
- Establish HP/EFP integration patterns

### v0.9.0: Comprehensive Performance Coverage
- 20+ High Performance Python rules
- Advanced performance detection
- Profiling data integration (if feasible)

### v1.0.0: Complete Dual-Book Platform
- Full coverage of both books
- Unified educational experience
- Advanced configuration and integration

## Success Metrics

### Analysis Quality
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All relevant "High Performance Python" patterns analyzed
- **No Duplication**: Clear differentiation from existing performance tools
- **Educational Value**: Each rule teaches performance concepts

### Integration Success
- **Unified Experience**: Consistent with EFP rules in format and quality
- **User Adoption**: HP rules adopted by existing EFP users
- **Performance Impact**: Measurable improvements in flagged code

### Ecosystem Impact
- **Gap Filling**: Address performance patterns missed by existing tools
- **Educational Platform**: Establish as go-to source for book-based Python optimization
- **Community Value**: Open source resource for performance learning

## Conclusion

The High Performance Python integration represents a natural evolution of flake8-patterns from a single-book educational tool to a comprehensive platform for learning Python best practices across multiple authoritative sources.

**Current Status**: Planning and preparation
**Next Milestone**: Complete Effective Python implementation first
**Future Potential**: Industry-leading educational linting platform

This analysis framework ensures we're prepared for successful Phase 4 expansion while maintaining focus on current Effective Python implementation priorities.
