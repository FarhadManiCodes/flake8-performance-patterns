# EP318: Parallel Iteration with zip()

**Book Reference**: "Effective Python" (3rd Edition), Item 18, Chapter 3: Functions  
**Tier**: 1 (High Impact)  
**Status**: Tier 1 Priority

## Overview

Use `zip()` to process iterators in parallel instead of manually indexing with `range(len())`. This is more Pythonic, safer, and handles different sequence lengths gracefully.

## Problem

Manual parallel iteration is verbose and error-prone:

```python
# ❌ Manual parallel iteration - verbose and brittle
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
ages = [25, 30, 35]
jobs = ["Engineer", "Designer", "Manager"]

for i in range(len(names)):
    name = names[i]      # Repetitive indexing
    age = ages[i]        # Risk of index errors
    job = jobs[i]        # What if lists have different lengths?
    print(f"{name} is {age} and works as {job}")

# ❌ Even worse - nested indexing
matrix1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
matrix2 = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
result = []
for i in range(len(matrix1)):
    row = []
    for j in range(len(matrix1[i])):
        row.append(matrix1[i][j] + matrix2[i][j])  # Index soup!
    result.append(row)
```

## Solution

Use `zip()` for clean parallel iteration:

```python
# ✅ Clean parallel iteration with zip()
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
ages = [25, 30, 35]
jobs = ["Engineer", "Designer", "Manager"]

for name, age, job in zip(names, ages, jobs):
    print(f"{name} is {age} and works as {job}")

# ✅ Handle different lengths with itertools.zip_longest()
from itertools import zip_longest

for name, age, job in zip_longest(names, ages, jobs, fillvalue="Unknown"):
    print(f"{name} is {age} and works as {job}")

# ✅ Matrix addition made clear
matrix1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
matrix2 = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
result = []
for row1, row2 in zip(matrix1, matrix2):
    result.append([a + b for a, b in zip(row1, row2)])

# ✅ Even better with list comprehension
result = [[a + b for a, b in zip(row1, row2)] 
          for row1, row2 in zip(matrix1, matrix2)]
```

## Detection Criteria

This rule detects:

1. **`range(len())` with parallel indexing**:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(items)):
       x = items[i]      # Using the index variable
       y = others[i]     # Parallel access - triggers EP318
   ```

2. **Multiple sequence access in loop body**:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(names)):
       name = names[i]   # First sequence
       age = ages[i]     # Second sequence - parallel pattern
   ```

3. **Nested parallel iteration**:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(outer)):
       for j in range(len(outer[i])):
           value = outer[i][j] + other[i][j]  # Parallel access
   ```

## When Not to Apply

- **Need the index value itself**:
  ```python
  # ✅ Index is actually used
  for i in range(len(items)):
      print(f"Item {i}: {items[i]}")  # i is needed
  
  # Better: use enumerate()
  for i, item in enumerate(items):
      print(f"Item {i}: {item}")
  ```

- **Complex indexing logic**:
  ```python
  # ✅ Non-sequential access
  for i in range(0, len(items), 2):  # Every other item
      process(items[i])
  ```

- **Single sequence access**:
  ```python
  # ✅ No parallel iteration
  for i in range(len(items)):
      process(items[i])  # Just use: for item in items
  ```

## Book Context

From Item 18: "The zip built-in function can be used to iterate over multiple iterators in parallel... zip creates a lazy generator that produces tuples."

Key benefits highlighted:
- Cleaner code with less visual noise
- Built-in handling of different sequence lengths
- No risk of index errors
- Works with any iterable, not just lists

## Gap Analysis

**Why no existing tool detects this**:
- Most tools focus on `range(len())` → `enumerate()` conversion
- They miss the parallel iteration pattern
- `zip()` usage requires analyzing loop body for multiple indexing
- Complex AST pattern matching needed

## Implementation Notes

**AST Pattern Detection**:
1. Detect `for i in range(len(sequence))` pattern
2. Analyze loop body for multiple `sequence[i]` accesses
3. Check if different sequences are accessed with same index
4. Suggest `zip()` replacement

**Complexity Analysis**:
- Count number of parallel sequences accessed
- Handle nested loops (matrix operations)
- Detect when index variable is used for other purposes

## Examples from the Wild

```python
# ❌ Data processing anti-pattern
def process_user_data(usernames, emails, ages):
    results = []
    for i in range(len(usernames)):
        username = usernames[i]
        email = emails[i]
        age = ages[i]
        if age >= 18:
            results.append(f"{username} <{email}>")
    return results

# ✅ Pythonic version
def process_user_data(usernames, emails, ages):
    results = []
    for username, email, age in zip(usernames, emails, ages):
        if age >= 18:
            results.append(f"{username} <{email}>")
    return results

# ❌ Coordinate manipulation
def calculate_distances(points1, points2):
    distances = []
    for i in range(len(points1)):
        x1, y1 = points1[i]
        x2, y2 = points2[i]
        dist = ((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)**0.5
        distances.append(dist)
    return distances

# ✅ Much cleaner
def calculate_distances(points1, points2):
    distances = []
    for (x1, y1), (x2, y2) in zip(points1, points2):
        dist = ((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)**0.5
        distances.append(dist)
    return distances

# ❌ CSV processing anti-pattern
def process_csv_rows(headers, row1, row2):
    comparison = {}
    for i in range(len(headers)):
        header = headers[i]
        val1 = row1[i]
        val2 = row2[i]
        comparison[header] = val1 == val2
    return comparison

# ✅ Elegant solution
def process_csv_rows(headers, row1, row2):
    return {header: val1 == val2 
            for header, val1, val2 in zip(headers, row1, row2)}
```

## Advanced Usage

```python
# ✅ Handle unequal lengths
from itertools import zip_longest

short = [1, 2]
long = [10, 20, 30, 40]

# Stops at shortest (default zip behavior)
list(zip(short, long))  # [(1, 10), (2, 20)]

# Continues to longest with fillvalue
list(zip_longest(short, long, fillvalue=0))  # [(1, 10), (2, 20), (0, 30), (0, 40)]

# ✅ Transpose matrices
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
transposed = list(zip(*matrix))  # [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
```

## Error Message Format

```
EP318 Manual parallel iteration detected, use zip()
→ 'Effective Python' (3rd Edition), Item 18, Chapter 3: Functions
→ Readability: Cleaner, safer, handles length differences gracefully  
→ Example: for i in range(len(a)): x=a[i]; y=b[i] → for x, y in zip(a, b)
```

## Performance Notes

- `zip()` is typically faster than manual indexing
- Creates lazy iterator - memory efficient
- No risk of IndexError from length mismatches
- Works with any iterable (lists, tuples, generators, etc.)
