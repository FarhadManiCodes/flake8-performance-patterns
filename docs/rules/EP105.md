# EP105: Multiple-Assignment Unpacking over Indexing

**Book Reference**: "Effective Python" (3rd Edition), Item 5, Chapter 1: Pythonic Thinking  
**Tier**: 1 (High Impact)  
**Status**: Implementation Priority #1

## Overview

Prefer multiple-assignment unpacking over sequential indexing when accessing elements from sequences. This pattern is more readable, less error-prone, and has the same performance characteristics.

## Problem

Sequential indexing is verbose and error-prone:

```python
# ❌ Sequential indexing - hard to read, easy to make mistakes
item = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")
name = item[0]     # What if this is the wrong index?
age = item[1]      # Error-prone
job = item[2]      # Repetitive

# ❌ More complex example
point = (10, 20)
x = point[0]
y = point[1]
distance = (x**2 + y**2)**0.5
```

## Solution

Use multiple-assignment unpacking:

```python
# ✅ Multiple-assignment unpacking - clear and concise
item = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")
name, age, job = item

# ✅ More complex example
point = (10, 20)
x, y = point
distance = (x**2 + y**2)**0.5

# ✅ Partial unpacking with catch-all
data = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer", "Python", "Remote")
name, age, *details = data
```

## Detection Criteria

This rule detects:

1. **Sequential indexing assignments** in the same scope:
   ```python
   x = item[0]   # First assignment
   y = item[1]   # Sequential index - triggers EP105
   ```

2. **Multiple variables from same sequence**:
   ```python
   first = data[0]
   second = data[1] 
   third = data[2]  # Three or more sequential accesses
   ```

3. **Common patterns**:
   - Tuple/list unpacking candidates
   - Coordinate extraction: `x = point[0]; y = point[1]`
   - Name/value pairs: `key = pair[0]; value = pair[1]`

## When Not to Apply

- **Non-sequential indices**: `x = item[0]; z = item[2]` (skipping index 1)
- **Different sequences**: `x = item1[0]; y = item2[0]`
- **Complex indexing**: `x = matrix[i][0]; y = matrix[i][1]` (may need different approach)
- **Single assignment**: `x = item[0]` (no pattern to improve)

## Book Context

From Item 5: "Multiple-assignment unpacking is more readable than accessing indexes. It often requires fewer lines of code. It's also more flexible for when the number of values to unpack changes."

The book emphasizes that this pattern:
- Reduces visual noise
- Makes code more self-documenting
- Prevents index-related bugs
- Handles different sequence lengths gracefully

## Implementation Notes

**AST Pattern Detection**:
1. Track consecutive `ast.Assign` nodes in same scope
2. Identify assignments with `ast.Subscript` targets
3. Check if subscripts access same variable with sequential indices
4. Suggest multiple-assignment unpacking

**False Positive Prevention**:
- Ignore non-sequential indices
- Ignore assignments separated by other statements
- Consider scope boundaries (function/class definitions)

## Examples from the Wild

```python
# ❌ Common anti-pattern in data processing
def process_user_data(user_tuple):
    name = user_tuple[0]
    email = user_tuple[1] 
    age = user_tuple[2]
    return f"{name} ({email}) is {age} years old"

# ✅ Improved version
def process_user_data(user_tuple):
    name, email, age = user_tuple
    return f"{name} ({email}) is {age} years old"

# ❌ Coordinate manipulation
def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    x1 = point1[0]
    y1 = point1[1]
    x2 = point2[0] 
    y2 = point2[1]
    return ((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)**0.5

# ✅ Much cleaner
def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    x1, y1 = point1
    x2, y2 = point2
    return ((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)**0.5
```
